# Mini Application (NodeJS and AWS)
### Made by Santiago Monsalve-Mejia
This simple app, was made for my Engineering Design 1 class *(spring 2021)*.
The goal of this project was to build an online application that had a data base connection, a working UI, and a connection to 
an outside hardware component; Unfortuionetly, due to time constrains, I was not able to implement the latter. I designed the application layer using NodeJS and Express; Thousand thanks to @humyrx for building my presentation layer. I used the handelbars templating engine to make the application dynamic.The hosting was done trough AWS, more specifically using the Elastic Beanstalk service.
The app itself does not do much, but I am still super proud of being able to, learn, implement and build something functional with a new technology!

Please feel free to visit and try the app yourself
